- [ ] Show reflection transformations
- [ ] Pattern statistics (most used patterns)
- [ ] Interactive pattern editor

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multiple personality modes (psychiatrist, friend, etc.)
- [ ] Sentiment analysis
- [ ] Response quality rating
- [ ] Conversation branching
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Voice input/output integration

### Code Quality

## Known Issues
- None currently

## Ideas for Exploration
- Could patterns be learned/adjusted based on usage?
- Integration with other ChrysaLisp apps
- Network-based multi-user ELIZA sessions
- Historical conversation analysis tool
